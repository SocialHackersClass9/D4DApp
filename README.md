This repository contains the Code of the project, **D4DApp** as a result of the collaboration between the students of `Class 9` of [Social Hackers Academy](socialhackersacademy.org) and [Irodikos](https://www.facebook.com/irodikos/).

The project will help disabled persons to find athletic opportunities with expertised teachers and is coordinated by [Vadim Ovcearenco ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vadim-ovcearenco-9754ab4/).
